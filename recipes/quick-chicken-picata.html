    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Piccata describes meat, usually veal or chicken, that is sliced, dredged in flour, browned,
         then served in a sauce containing lemon juice, butter, and capers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
        <li>cayenne pepper to taste </li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>all-purpose flour for dredging </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained </li>
        <li>½ cup white wine </li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice </li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut in 1/4-inch slices </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. 
            Firmly pound chicken breasts with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper; dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Place chicken in the pan, reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5 minutes per side; remove to a plate.</li>
        <li>Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until warmed through, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour white wine into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. 
            Cook until reduced by half, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. 
            Reduce heat to low and stir parsley through the sauce.</li>
        <li>Return chicken breasts to the pan and cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve with sauce spooned over the top.</li>
    </ol>
